    <h1>CSS Margin Shorthand</h1>

    <div>
        The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

        With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for
        each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
    </div>
